# python-sample-script

This program is run from the command line, and creates three files in the same directory as the script. Each file will contain 10 random characters from the lowercase alphabet with no spaces in between. The program will print out the contents of the three files to the screen, and then print out two random integers between 1 and 42, as well as the product of those two numbers.
